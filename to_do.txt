-------- GENERAL ---------------------

- Get the updated 2014 RPM data (pureRAPM)

- Teams that show up as NA (Seattle Sonics, Vancouver Grizzlies, New Jersey Nets, New Orleans Hornets, more to find)

- Mention how good home does as a feature, show that we need to improve on the 60 % baseline (Could be a good plot for the poster)

- Could test best (tell all) metrics on their predictive accuracy. 

- Look into Brooklyn (0 wins?, maybe the year they moved)

- Write a script that obtains the current NBA rosters so we can simulate the 2014 season 

---------- REALISTIC PROJECT GOALS ------------------------------

- Write a script that obtains the current NBA rosters so we can simulatethe 2014 season 

- Try out more algorithms on the RAPM dataset

- Get new feature which has last seasons win percentage. Maybe compute current season as well?

- Get more than one season incorporated into the statistics? (Big Reach)


------- MIDTERM REVIEW NOTES ----------------

RAPM - Individual (scalar) player statistic.

Putting the dataset online. Github? Other suggestions on how to do this? Need to make sure it's totally accurate

RPI section- Talk about how we need to use it to give some signals about how good the team was last year (Which we don't have in our current dataset). Maybe we don't need tiers, and can use the pure metrix as a feature. 


----- FUTURE GOALS -------------

- Scrape play by play data and calculate our own RAPM statistic

- Mention "All in One" Statistic predictive accuracy 

- Mention home team wins 60 % of games, maybe get a table of JUST home teams 

- How to simulate games without knowing the players who played beforehand (Using % games payed of previous season to choose players involved pregame)

- How does the predictions do against the spread?
