- How to simulate games without knowing the players who played beforehand (Using % games payed of previous season to choose players involved pregame)

- How does the predictions do against the spread? (Predictiing against the spread)

- Clustering players based on a set of features- features are rates. \


- STEPS set up mongo on the computer.
