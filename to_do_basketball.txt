-------- MEETINGS ---------------------

-  None


-------- TO LOOK INTO ---------------------


- Teams that show up as NA (Seattle Sonics, Vancouver Grizzlies, New Jersey Nets, New Orleans Hornets, more to find)

- Look into Brooklyn (0 wins with Naive Bayes Season??, maybe the year they moved)


----- FUTURE GOALS -------------


- Could test best (tell all) metrics on their predictive accuracy. 

- Look into Rookie Projections 

- Scrape play by play data and calculate our own RAPM statistic

- How to simulate games without knowing the players who played beforehand (Using % games payed of previous season to choose players involved pregame)

- How does the predictions do against the spread? (Predictiing against the spread)

- Clustering players based on a set of features- features are rates. 

- Create Shiny app with the time series
